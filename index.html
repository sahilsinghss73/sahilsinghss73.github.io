        	<p>Hi! I am Rajat Kumar Jenamani. I am a final-year undergraduate student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I am interested in search and motion planning. I also do Sports Programming for fun!
            </p>
            <p>I am working with <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~ppchak/">Prof. Partha Pratim Chakrabarti</a> on Multi-Agent Pathfinding for my undergraduate thesis.
            </p>
